# Power Supply Case

This is a small project for an lasercut enclosure for [this 12V switching PSU from Aliexpress](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002728038351.html) which is also available from many other vendors.

## Background
The idea was originally to 3D-print the case, but recently gaining access to a lasercutter I decided to go that route. The `simple_case` variant is just the walls of the 3D enclosure with the corresponding holes whereas the `*_cut` variant has added tabs with the `LCInterlocking` workbench. The `*.svg` files are then used for cutting.

## Features
Instead of measuring and parameterizing the model myself I decided to look for the models on [grabcad.com](GrabCAD) and base all cuts on them. I used the following models in the design process which can also be found in the `3d_models` folder:
* [S-60-12](https://grabcad.com/library/s-60-12-1) PSU Model by Aleksander Ugnenko
* [IEC320_AC-14](https://grabcad.com/library/iec320-c14-1) Power Connector Model by Richard Bruning (currently not used)
* [IEC320_AC-17](https://grabcad.com/library/ac-power-socket-3-pin-250v-10a-ac-17-iec3-c14-1) Power Connector Model by Igor Vladimirovich
* [DC_Jack_5.5mm/2.1mm](https://grabcad.com/library/dc-jack-5-5-x-2-1-mm-1) Model by Yannik Fink
